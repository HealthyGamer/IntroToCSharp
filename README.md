# Intro to C\#

## Setup

I'll be demoing using Visual Studio 2022. The Community edition is free and available here: <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/>

Other options are [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (also free) and [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) (**not** free). If you use Visual Studio Code you'll also want to install the C# extension.
